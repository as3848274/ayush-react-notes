// babel  -  Js compiler used to convert js code written using latest features to older version of js or old js syntax so we write the js code using all the latest feature and then convert it into old js syntax using babel because not all browsers supports Ecmascript6 and Ecmascript7 syntax and no browser will support JSX syntax.. 

// babel is a tool basically used to convert ECMAscript6 syntax into ECMAscript5. It is also grew to support transpling JSX syntax into pure React..


// React is a library !!
// Framework - miliatry
// library - cool dude (freedom)
